## Summary
The average renter kept the bike for 3 to 4 hours. Male renters were higher than female renters. The slowest times of rental where between 12am thru 5am. The steadest times where Monday through Friday at 5pm. With Monday being the highest and Tuesday being the second highest. 
Though Citibike was successful in New York, other factors need to be analyzed to truly determine if it will be a success for Des Moines, Iowa. First it would be a good idea to compare the population of the two cities. Compare the average weather throughout the year for the two. Possibly surveying the citizens of Des Moines to determine how they would feel about the service and if they would want to use it.
